  <h2 class="page-title">Goals</h2>

  <p>We've set out the follow goals for this project:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      We are dedicated to keeping this project, data, code and community open in an effort to
      make all aspects of the project better.
    </li>
    <li>
      We need your help to make this project work. We are encouraging open collaboration on this
      project to produce a useful database.
    </li>
    <li>
      AcousticBrainz, Essentia and the community around both create a feedback loop. This feedback
      loop is designed to expose the data and algorithms to more people in a collaborative effort to
      improve the algorithms and training data. With better input, Essentia and AcousticBrainz will
      create better data over time. This process will take many iterations over a long time period.
    </li>
    <li>
      Essentia is continually being improved with feedback from both the AcousticBrainz community
      and the wider research community. We value input to improve the quality and accuracy of data
      that we add to AcousticBrainz.
    </li>
    <li>
      The AcousticBrainz database is a living document. While we believe the low-level data is relatively
      stable we are still soliciting improvements to this data and also to the high-level data. We will
      work with the community to update the data as soon as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are not going to hide problems with our data. Weâ€™re interested to hear about the problems you
      find in the data. When we can identify problems, we can work to solve them.
    </li>
    <li>
      We challenge ourselves and everyone around us to think differently about these problems. We would
      like to avoid falling into the common pitfalls and we would like to encourage everyone to find new
      and novel approaches to solve our problems.
    </li>
  </ol>
