Deployment Practices
====================

We run two instances of AcousticBrainz on the same data.

* AcousticBrainz (https://acousticbrainz.org)
* AcousticBrainz beta (https://beta.acousticbrainz.org)


The beta instance is used to test new features and bugfixes on the actual
dataset before being officially deployed into production.

We follow the general `MetaBrainz guidelines`_ to deploy, test and release
code into beta and production.
