# MusicBrainz Android app

The official android app for MusicBrainz. MusicBrainz for Android lets users search metadata all of the the metadata available on MusicBrainz. Users can scan barcode to search albums. Registered users can view, edit and modify their collections. Users can also tag their audio files.

# What's next

* The tagger is still in initial stages. The app needs to achieve complete usability with the desktop version of Picard. This requires that we support all the tags as Picard.
* Moving a larger part of the codebase to Kotlin.
* Incorporate functionality from more *Brainz.
