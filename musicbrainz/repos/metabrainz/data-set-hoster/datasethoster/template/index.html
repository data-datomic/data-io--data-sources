<h2>MetaBrainz Dataset Hoster Home</h2>

<p>
  You can use this data set hoster to explore the various data sets that are being 
  exposed through this interface. The goal of this interface is to make the
  discovery of hosted data quick and intuitive - ideally the interface should
  give you all of the information necessary in order start using one of these
  APIs in your project quickly.
<p>

<p>
  The following data sets are available from here:
</p>

<ul>
  {% for slug in queries %}
    <li><a href="/{{ slug }}" style="color: #E80;">{{ slug }}</a>: {{ queries[slug].names()[1] }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>
   Use the web interface for each of these endpoints to discover what parameters to send
   and what results to expect. Then take the JSON GET or POST example data to integrate
   these calls into your projects.
