    "The website and email inputs have respectively been tokenized to their top 1024 entries and are embedded into 256-dimensional vectors. Meanwhile the user biography input is just reshaped into one 512-dimensional vector, as it is already quasi-embedded.\n",

    "All three inputs are then passed into LSTMs where the bio-LSTM has an output twice as large as the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of the LSTMS are then concatenated with the other inputs (area set, non-zero privs, bio length, etc.) and passed into a stack of two fully-connected layers with 64 neurons and 50% dropout each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output layer consists of two neurons that represent the classification confidence for each category (spam and non-spam) and are activated using softmax so that their sum will always be one."
