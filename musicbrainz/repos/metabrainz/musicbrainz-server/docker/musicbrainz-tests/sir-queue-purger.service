# In the CircleCI environment, script/reset_selenium_env.sh runs as the
# musicbrainz user because it's invoked by t/selenium.js. The
# musicbrainz user can't run rabbitmqctl, however; only root or the
# rabbitmq user can. To work around that, we touch a file named
# .purge_sir_queues in reset_selenium_env.sh that triggers this
# service (which runs as root) to purge the search queues for us.
